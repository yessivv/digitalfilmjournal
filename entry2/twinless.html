    <p>
        The film Twinless was a whirlwind of emotions to sit through. At first I related to the characters feeling of missing a part of you due 
        to the loss of someone. Though I knew this film wouldn't focus too long on the sadness. 
        Examining all the scenes I kept trying to decipher what made this film a thriller, thinking maybe someone will hunt them down
        or it would quickly become a cheesy murder film although that wasn't the case. Once the plot twist hit everyone in the theater burst into laughter
        due to the way the scenes were shot. Something about everyone laughing in the theater gave a feeling of comfort to the disturbance in the film.
        I loved the character dynamic and I felt myself understanding each character's action making the film feel more genuine. No character was villianized even 
        though there was an antagonist. The use of dark humor was especially great since it felt like an easy watch, not too overwhelming or saddening. I would
        definetly watch this again on the couch with the cup of tea and a snack.

                Just like Dennis (played by James Sweeney) I am also an only child. I was able to understand his longing or fascination
            with twins/siblings. A parent relationship is not the same as a sibling relationship. As a child I would always ask for a sibling
        since I felt alone. Although when my mom began babysitting the girl in the photo, Allison, I quickly became jealous and tried pushing
        her off the bed. I didn't end up doing it fortunately but I was glad when she left for Washington D.C.  </p>

        <div class="content-2">
            <p>
                The chubby bunny challenge was a popular game in 2014 where you would fit as many marshmellows as you could in your mouth and say
                chubby bunny. When Dennis and Rocky played this game it reminded me of the time my childhood best friend and I played this. It was
                very disgusting I wouldn't do it again but in the moment it was fun and we laughed so much none of us could win.

                Once Rocky got a girlfriend, Dennis felt upset trying to seperate them. This wikihow posts reminded me of that scene. 
                I never want to be considered the friend that brings their boyfriend everywhere or forgets their friends, although I think
                I became that to my best friend which I have been trying to improve on by visiting her at Pratt more frequently.
