<p> After The Hunt was quite an interesting watch since it spoke on many topics relating to prestige, tethered closely to 
    the school I attend now. The film took place in Yale University with a student, Maggie, who acuses her male teacher, Henrik or Hank, of sexually assualting
    her. Maggie had a close relationship with her professer Alma. Early in the film Maggie is portrayed as being obssessed with Alma
    therefore the accusation felt false since Henrik and Alma had a close relationship. I loved that the film didn't write a narrative to
    simply villianize one character, instead I found myself understanding all narratives as nor wrong or right (Not defending Hank, as you watch you
    don't know who to trust). Growing up in Connecticut, Yale has always been captured in film as a high achieving University although in the film, Maggie plagarizes her essay, 
    changing the perception that is often portrayed in the media. I felt it spoke alot on the prestige of schools and how common it is to see a facade, it has become difficult
    to believe a generation with such access to plagarism will continue to uphold the stature of these well-known schools.

        things I connected to the film
    </h3>

       <p>White Business Men in a Room</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                When Maggie spoke to her professor, Alma, about being sexually assaulted, she said to keep it to herself since it would
                prevent her from finding a job in the future since men would be scared of 'touching her shoulder for too long'. The mention of
                jobs as a response to a traumatic situation sparked a multiude of thoughts in many unfair circumstances. Many women that experience
                a similar situation are forced to stay silent since they are then punished with the struggle to find a need for survival. The comment being
                made from a women really expands on how normalized workplace assualt has become. </p>

        <p>Rory in Her Yale-ified Room</p>
        <div class="contents">
            <p>
                In Gilmore Girls, from the start of the series Rory is determined to attend Harvard, although due to her Grandfather's relationship
                with Yale University, she decides to attend Yale. After one discouraging comment, Rory then drops out of Yale. In Gossip Girl, Yale is often
                mentioned through various characters due to the prestige and Ivy title. After the Hunt almost normalized the feeling of attending Yale, instead of
                glorifying it, it almost undermined its reputation. Henrik being fired for sexually assualting a student speaks well on their morals but
                sparks a conversation of how this claim was started in the first place, from Maggie 'hanging out' with Alma and Henrik late at night.

            <p>
                During the apartment scene interaction between Maggie and Alma, the setting reminded me of Long Wharf New Haven, this was a place I would
                drive past often with my mom and dad. I hadn't seen this place in a while until my cousin moved in with my mom and I. This summer we went to the
                food trucks along the water again. It brought me back to one of my favorite spots.
