            The first film to start of this site is Weapons directed by Zach Creggar, starring Julia Garner, Amy Madigan, Josh Brolin, and Austin 
            Abrams. At first impressions, I presumed the film would exclude intense gore due to the victims being 
            children; it felt too intense to portray a plot around harming children. Instead, the plot works to enlighten 
            the viewer on the struggles they face from a system meant to protect them. During the writing process, Zach 
            Cregger had lost a friend close to him. His grief created a stronger story dynamic by writing about the 
            perspective everyone felt toward the disappearance of the children. All the different lives, the mix of emotions, 
            and even characters who would often be overlooked. I personally found this story to be more comedic than terrifying although
            I enjoyed watching it.
